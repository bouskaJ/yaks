Requirements:

- Go 1.13+
- Operator SDK 0.19.4+
- Maven 3.6.2+
- Git client

You can build the YAKS project and get the `yaks` CLI by running:

[source,shell script]
----
make build
----

If you want to build the operator image locally for development in Minishift for instance, then:

[source,shell script]
----
# Build binaries and images
eval $(minishift docker-env)
make clean images-no-test
----

If the operator pod is running, just delete it to let it grab the new image.

[source,shell script]
----
oc delete pod yaks
----
