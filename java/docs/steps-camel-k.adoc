== Apache Camel K steps

If the subject under test is a Camel K integration, you can leverage the YAKS Camel K bindings
that provide useful steps for checking the status of integrations.

For example:

[source,gherkin]
----
   ...
   Given integration xxx is running
   Then integration xxx should print Hello world!
----

The Camel K extension library is provided by default in YAKS.
