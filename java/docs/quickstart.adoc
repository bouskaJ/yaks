= Getting started

Assuming you have a Kubernetes playground and that you are connected to a namespace on that cluster
just write a `helloworld.feature` BDD file with the following content:

.helloworld.feature
[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: Hello

  Scenario: Print hello message
    Given print 'Hello from YAKS!'
----

You can then execute the following command using the https://github.com/citrusframework/yaks/releases/[YAKS CLI tool]:

[source,shell script]
----
yaks test helloworld.feature
----

This runs the test immediately on the current namespace in your connected Kubernetes cluster.
Nothing else is needed.

Continue reading the documentation and learn how to install and get started working with YAKS.
