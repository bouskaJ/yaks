== JDBC steps

YAKS provides a library that allows to execute SQL actions on relational DBs (limited to PostgreSQL for this POC).

You can find examples of JDBC steps in the xref:../../examples/jdbc/jdbc.feature[examples] file.

There's also an example that uses xref:../../examples/openapi/task-api.feature[JDBC and REST together] and targets the
https://github.com/syndesisio/todo-example[Syndesis TODO App] database.
